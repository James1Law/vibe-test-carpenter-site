### Code-Splitting Strategy
```
Eager-loaded (above fold):
- Hero section
- About section
- Services section

Lazy-loaded (below fold):
- Gallery section
- Testimonials section
- Contact section

Bundle Chunks:
- react: React core libraries
- forms: react-hook-form + zod + resolvers
- ui: lucide-react icons
```

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### TDD (Test-Driven Development) - MANDATORY
All code changes MUST follow the TDD cycle:

1. **RED** - Write failing test first
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Clean up while keeping tests green

### Baseline Coverage Protocol
Before any feature/change:
```bash
make baseline-coverage  # Save starting coverage
# ... write tests and implementation ...
make test-ci            # Run tests with coverage
# Compare with baseline - no regression allowed
rm baseline-coverage.txt  # Clean up when done
```

### Local Development Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run type-check       # TypeScript compilation check
npm run lint             # ESLint checks
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix ESLint issues

# Testing
make test                # Run tests in watch mode
make test-unit           # Run unit tests once
make test-e2e            # Run E2E tests
make test-ci             # Run with coverage (CI mode)
make ci                  # Full CI pipeline locally

# Production
npm run build            # TypeScript + Vite production build
npm run preview          # Serve production build locally

# Utilities
make baseline-coverage   # Save coverage baseline
make clean               # Remove test artifacts
make help                # Show all make targets
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/description
# ... make changes with TDD ...
make ci                  # Verify all checks pass
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin feature/description
# Create PR on GitHub
# GitHub Actions runs CI automatically
# Merge when all checks pass
```

### Deployment Flow
```
1. Push to feature branch → Vercel preview deployment
2. Create PR → GitHub Actions CI runs
3. Merge to main → Vercel production deployment
4. Production live at wrightanglecarpentry.co.uk
```

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables (Vercel)
```
RESEND_API_KEY=***           # Email service API key
RESEND_FROM=onboarding@...   # Sender email
RESEND_TO=james@...          # Recipient email
```

### Secrets Management
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ Environment variables for API keys
- ✅ `.gitignore` protects local configs
- ✅ `.claude/` directory excluded from git
- ✅ Baseline coverage files temporary only

### MCP Server Configuration
Located in `.cursor/mcp.json`:
- **Memory Server:** Structured entity-relationship facts
- **Context7:** Real-time code understanding
- **GitHub:** PR and issue management
- **Playwright:** E2E test automation

All MCP servers use environment variables for credentials.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Technical Debt

### Content
- ❌ **Testimonials:** Still using placeholder data (requires client outreach)
- ⚠️ **Gallery:** AI-generated images (real project photos pending)
- ⚠️ **About Section:** Could be expanded with more storytelling

### Technical
- ⚠️ **Test Coverage:** Only contactSchema.ts has tests (need more unit tests)
- ⚠️ **E2E Coverage:** Only contact form tested (need gallery, navigation tests)
- ⚠️ **Component Tests:** No component-level tests yet
- ⚠️ **Performance Monitoring:** No analytics setup in production
- ⚠️ **Error Tracking:** No error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

### Infrastructure
- ⚠️ **Email Sender:** Using Resend onboarding domain (needs custom domain verification)
- ⚠️ **CDN:** Images served from Vercel (consider Cloudinary/Imgix for optimization)
- ⚠️ **CMS:** Static content in code (no CMS for non-technical updates)

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority (Phase 5)
1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add component tests for all sections
   - Add unit tests for utilities (seo.ts, structuredData.ts)
   - E2E tests for gallery and navigation
   - Target: 80%+ coverage across the board

2. **Real Testimonials**

   - Use branded sender email
   - Custom email templates

6. **SEO Enhancements**

   - Case studies for featured projects
   - Local SEO citations (Google My Business)

### Future Enhancements
7. **CMS Integration**
   - Sanity.io or Contentful
   - Non-technical content updates
   - Gallery and testimonials management

8. **Advanced Features**
