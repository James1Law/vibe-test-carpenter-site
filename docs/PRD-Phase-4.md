### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Hero Section Mobile Layout Bug Fix

**Purpose:** Fix MapPin icon misalignment on mobile viewport in Hero section.

**Bug Description:**
- The MapPin icon next to "Proudly serving Wareham, Poole, Dorset, surrounding towns" is skewed/shifted to the left on mobile screens
- Located in `src/sections/Hero.tsx` at line 30-33
- Icon and text are in a flex container with `justify-center` but text wrapping on mobile causes misalignment

**Root Cause:**
The flex container with `items-center justify-center gap-2` doesn't handle text wrapping properly on narrow mobile screens. When the service area text wraps to multiple lines, the icon remains vertically centered to the entire flex container rather than aligning with the first line of text.

**Implementation Tasks:**

**T28-1: Fix Mobile Text Wrapping**
- Adjust flex container to handle multi-line text properly
- Consider centering the entire flex container as a block
- Ensure icon stays aligned with first line of text or centered with full text block
- Test on various mobile viewport widths (320px, 375px, 414px)

**T28-2: Alternative Layout for Mobile**
- Consider responsive layout changes for mobile:
  - Stack icon above text on very small screens
  - Remove icon on mobile (keep desktop only)
  - Use responsive padding/margin adjustments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ MapPin icon properly aligned on mobile viewports
- ‚úÖ No horizontal overflow or skewing
- ‚úÖ Text wraps gracefully without breaking layout
- ‚úÖ Desktop layout unaffected
- ‚úÖ Tested on mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)
